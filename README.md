## Aim -
c++ programs for decision making statements
## Theory -
Decision-making statements control the flow of a program based on conditions. Key types include:

1. *If-Else Statement*: Executes one block if the condition is true, another if false.
2. *Nested if-else statements* are used when you need to check multiple conditions in a hierarchical manner. An if or else block can contain another if-else statement inside it. This is useful for more complex decision-making processes.
3.  *calculator statement*:it is used for doing mathematical calculations among some given values.
4.  *Switch Case Statement*: Used in some languages to handle multiple conditions, mimicked in Python using dictionaries.
